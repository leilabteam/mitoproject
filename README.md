#Introduction
This repository contains the codebase for a comprehensive analysis of bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. The bulk RNA-Seq analysis includes quality control, dimensional reduction, differential gene expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis. The scRNA-Seq analysis focuses on data preprocessing, normalization, integration, dimensional reduction, clustering, and visualization.

#Project Structure
The project is organized into two main scripts, each dedicated to a specific type of RNA-Seq analysis. Below is a brief overview of each script and its functionality:

#Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis (bulkrnaseq.R)
#QC and Preprocessing
The script starts with quality control of the RNA-Seq data using FastQC and MultiQC, followed by trimming the reads using Trimmomatic. The cleaned data is then quantified using kallisto with bias correction and bootstrapping.

#Correlation and Dimensionality Reduction
After preprocessing, the script generates a correlation heatmap to assess the similarity between samples. It also performs dimensionality reduction (PCA) to visualize the sample distribution in a lower-dimensional space.

#Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis
The script uses DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes between conditions. It generates a volcano plot to visualize the significance and magnitude of changes in gene expression.

#Functional Enrichment Analysis
The script performs Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses to identify biological pathways and processes that are significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes.

#Single-cell RNA-Seq Analysis (scRNAseqmitofinal.R)
Library Installation and Data Loading
The script installs and loads necessary R packages, such as Seurat and Harmony. It then reads the single-cell RNA-Seq data from specified directories.

#Data Preprocessing and Quality Control
The script preprocesses the data by labeling cells, merging multiple samples, and creating a Seurat object. It generates violin plots to visualize quality control metrics before and after filtering.

#Normalization and Dimensionality Reduction
The script normalizes the data, identifies variable features, and scales the data. It performs PCA and Harmony integration to correct for batch effects, followed by UMAP for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.

#Visualization and Downstream Analysis
The script visualizes the clustering results using UMAP plots and generates feature plots for specific genes. It also performs differential expression analysis to identify cluster-specific marker genes.

#Subset Analysis and Custom Plots
The script allows for subsetting specific cell populations and creating custom plots, such as DotPlots and heatmaps, to visualize gene expression patterns in different conditions.
